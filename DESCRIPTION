Description: The glm.deploy package provides two functions that generate source code implementing the 
  predict function of fitted glm objects. 
  In this version, code can be generated for either C or JAVA. The idea is to provide a tool  
  for the easy and fast deployment of glm predictive models into production. The source code generated 
  by this package implements two function/methods. One of such functions implements the equivalent to 
  predict(type="response"), while the second implements predict(type="link"). Source code is written
  to disk as a .c or .java file in the current working directory, unless an absolute path is specified 
  for the output filename. In the case of c, an .h file is also generated.
